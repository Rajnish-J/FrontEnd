we are having three memory or space

(i) call stack
(ii) node API
(iii) callBack queue

Initially all the functions and objects except asynchronous methods will execute first and put the asynchronous methods in the node API block
if all the synchronous methods executed its once again checks and move to call QUEUE and then its execute the asynchronous methods
